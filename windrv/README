Windows device drivers.

Most of the code here cannot be independently compiled with DOSLIB.
It must be compiled using non-free Device Driver Kits.

needed to compile Windows device drivers with open source tools.

dosboxpi .............. DOSBox pointer integration
ps2mouse .............. Basic PS/2 mouse driver
dosboxgi .............. DOSBox Integrated Graphics driver
