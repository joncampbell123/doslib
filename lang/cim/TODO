NEXT TO DO:

alignas(x)         [DONE] Allow increasing alignment, but by C++ standard, you cannot decrease alignment below natural alignment of data type. [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/alignas]
                   [DONE] GCC behavior: You can specify a smaller alignas() but GCC will not allow alignas() below natural alignment.

alignas(x)         alignas() with struct requires a specific ordering that will require changes to struct and union declaration specifier parsing.

                   alignas(x) struct test { ... } var;                 alignas() applies to var, has no effect on struct. no effect on sizeof().
                   struct alignas(x) test { ... } var;                 alignas() applies to struct, has no effect on var. also affects sizeof().
                   alignas(x) struct alignas(y) test { ... } var;      alignas(x) applies to var, alignas(y) applies to struct. also affects sizeof() to accomodate y.
                   struct test alignas() { ... } var;                  syntax error

__attribute__((...)) GCC extension, syntax handling

__attribute__((align(x))) GCC extension, functions the same as alignas().

#pragma pack(...)  Allow forcing a smaller struct packing. This is the only way to force alignment below natural alignment.
                   Microsoft C++ extension, initially at least [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/pack?view=msvc-170]
                   Microsoft C++ suggests that structure alignment is always capped to some default according to the platform or by the /Zp option.
                   GCC behavior: When pack(push,n) is in effect, alignment larger than n is limited to n. If "8" is in effect, alignment larger than 8 is capped to 8 bytes.
                                 pack(push,1) is often used to byte pack the structure members together to eliminate padding, no questions asked.
                                 If not in use, GCC will apply alignment as large as necessary for the data types involved.
                   Question: What does #pragma pack combined with alignas() do? If I used a #pragma pack to enforce a 4-byte alignment can alignas() still use a larger alignment?
                             Is that possible with GCC? Microsoft C/C++? Open Watcom C/C++?

Struct extension:  Fields with no name, specifically to allow you to specifically define padding in the structure.

Struct extension:  Some kind of syntax added to fields where you can specifically give the offset of the field in bytes.
                   Fields given afterward are positioned sequentially after that offset. Yes, we're going to allow overlaps and gaps.
