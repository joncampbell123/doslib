Like C, but without the preprocessor macro system.
Unless you ask for it, you can code pure naked code without a runtime.
Include source code with an include("path") rather than #include.

Inspired by Node.js, include() can return a value from the header like
require() returns whatever the Node module returns.

Instead of #ifdef, #if, etc. you write compile-time C-like code to manage
things and define runtime code too. Yes, you'll do an if(WIN32) { ... } instead of
#ifdef WIN32. Yay.

Near, far, pointers on x86 because I intend this compiler to support
DOS and Win16 development. For 386 and higher targets, you can define
near pointers with 32-bit offsets, and FAR pointers with 32-bit offsets
(48-bit 16:32) i.e. if you intend to use Flat Real Mode (setting up
Flat Real Mode of course is handled by a library you include, not built-in).

Want Open Watcom style "huge" pointers? That's an include() away.

include() may also contain compile-time code to specify libraries to load
at link time.

Functions C-like but extra syntax if you want to do things like define a
function that accepts specific parameters to/from CPU registers.

Allow C++ style pass-by-reference functions &parameters.

Named function parameters (inspired by Python) except that name=value would
be awkward to implement in a C-like syntax, so it would be name:value instead.
Example:

int do_something(int code,int value,long param) {
	...
}

int main() {
	int y = do_something(code:5,value:19,param:300);
}

Also inspired by Python, the function parameter list can specify * to mean
that parameters past that point MUST be filled in by name.

int do_something(int code,*,int value,long param) {
	...
}

int main() {
	int not_allowed = do_something(5,19,30); /* not allowed! */
	int this_is_ok = do_something(code:5,value:19,param:300); /* OK */
	int also_ok = do_something(5,value:19,param:300); /* "code" preceeds * while value and param must be named ,this is OK too */
}

The only exception to the rule is the ellipsis, which must not be named
because that would make no sense even if past the * marker.

By default, all named parameters must be filled in to call a function
properly. In the case of do_something(int code,int value,long param),
it is an error to fail to specify all parameters:

    do_something(code:5); /* error: value and param must be given values */

Inspired by C++, the function can specify default values for parameters.

int do_something(int code,int value=0,long param=-1) {
	...
}

If a parameter is not specified, then the default value is passed on call.

Like C++, if a function is called with positional parameters (without named
parameters), then once a default value is specified for a parameter, all
parameters after that must specify a default parameter.

    do_something(5); /* OK, value == 0, param == -1 */
    do_something(5,0); /* OK, param == -1 */

Non-contiguous parameters having default values are allowed. If called with
positional parameters, all values up to the last non-default param must be
filled in.

int do_something(int code=0,int value,long param=-1,long param2=-1,long param3=-1) {
	...
}

    do_something(5); /* error: value must be specified, param has default value */
    do_something(5,3); /* OK: code == 5, value == 3, param == -1, etc. */
    do_something(5,3,100); /* OK: code == 5, value == 3, param == 100, param2 == -1 and so on */

int do_something(int code=0,int value,long param=-1,long flags,long param2=-1,long param3=-1) {
    ...
}

    do_something(5); /* error: value and flags must be filled in */
    do_something(5,0); /* error: flags must be filled in */
    do_something(5,0,-1,32); /* OK: code==5, value==0, param==-1, flags==32, param2==-1,param3==-1*/

If called with named parameters, all parameters with no default value must be filled in.

int do_something(int code=0,int value,long param=-1,long param2=-1,long param3=-1) {
	...
}

    do_something(value:3); /* OK: code == 0, param == -1, and so on */
    do_something(code:9); /* error: value must be filled in */

int do_something(int code=0,int value,long param=-1,long flags,long param2=-1,long param3=-1) {
    ...
}

    do_something(value:3); /* error: flags must be filled in */
    do_something(value:3,flags:32); /* OK: code==0,value==3,param==-1,flags==32, etc */

The default value of a parameter can be a constant or the return value of a
compile time function call. A runtime function call is also allowed to return
a value, if that is done, a function declaration must be listed in compile
order prior to the function definition or declaration using it in the
parameter list. The functions will be called in an undefined order to
determine the default parameter value. Whether the runtime default parameter
causes any significant performance cost or dependencies or not is entirely up
to you.

To support assembly language calls and interaction, the parameter list may
specify that the parameter is associated with a CPU register on entry, and the
return value may specify an association with a CPU register to fill on exit.

/* external assembly language code (x86) will fill EAX with code, EBX with value, and it expects a return value in EAX */
int cpu_register(eax) do_something(int cpu_register(eax) code,int cpu_register(ebx) value) {
    return code + (value << 16);
}

If this function is called by other C code, then that C code will use the same
calling convention, provided that the function declaration did not differ in
any way between source files, of course.

CPU registers may also be listed C++ style pass by reference if a more complex
interaction is required. CPU flags count as a register, though in a more
restricted manner. To guarantee sure CPU flags are returned from a function as
expected, make the assignment the last step in the function before returning.
CPU instructions between the assignment and return can change CPU flags.
The compiler must emit a warning in that case if it cannot preserve the flags
register during any additional code before return.

cpu::flags() assignment, depending on the target, register named and value or
whether it is constant, may be converted to a specialized CPU instruction
instead of more general flags manipulation. cpu::flags() with no parameters
will evaluate to the entire flags register.

/* The exact names in the CPU namespace differ depending on the target. This
example depicts a 32-bit Intel 386 target. Because of the names involved, you
should NOT include the CPU namespace in your code with "using namespace cpu;",
that is a bad idea. */

void do_something(int cpu::register(eax) &code,int cpu::register(ebx) &value) {
	if (code == 6) {
		code = 0;
		value = 1000;
		cpu::flags(cpu::CF) = 0; /* this will compile to CLC */
	}
	else {
		code = -1;
		value = -1;
		cpu::flags(cpu::CF) = 1; /* this will compile to STC */
	}
}

/* x86 cpu::flags assignment specialization:

   cpu::CF = CLC/STC
   cpu::IF = CLI/STI

   If value read and saved to an appropriately sized integer on stack within
   a functional scope { ... } and restored on exiting the scope:

   PUSHF
   (functional scope)
   POPF

   Therefore a block of code that must execute with interrupts disabled could:

   {
       unsigned int saved_fl = cpu::flags();
       cpu::flags(cpu::IF) = 0
       ...
       cpu::flags() = saved_fl;
   }

   To produce:

   PUSHF
   CLI
   ...
   POPF (which restores the IF flag)

   * VM86 warning: There is a known issue with Windows in which POPF does not
     notify the VM86 monitor that interrupts have been re-enabled except for
     an Intel extension added in the Pentium processor called the Virtual
     Interrupt Flag. If the code does not work properly in that environment,
     add cpu::flags(cpu::IF) = 1 before the cpu::flags() = saved_fl to instead
     produce:

     PUSHF
     CLI
     ...
     STI
     POPF

   Everything else: PUSHF, POP (E)AX, (operation(s) on AX), PUSH (E)AX, POPF.
   For code size and performance, use sparingly.

   Depending on the environment and stack, the compiler may also opt to PUSHF
   at function entry, and direct CPU flag modifications to the memory image
   on stack to be applied on return at POPF before return, especially if the
   function declares a variable on stack that is assigned the value of
   cpu::flags().

Due to optimization, multiple steps of arithmetic cannot rely on CPU flags
between the steps unless a compiler::barrier() is placed between the steps
to ensure that the two operations occur exactly in the order written.

As a more general method of using carry between arithmetic, use
cpu::add_and_check_carry(), which adds two numbers together and then returns a
boolean to indicate whether carry occurred. This is only available if the
target has an ADD instruction that uses a CPU flag register of some kind to
signal carry, otherwise, it is not available.

    /* behaves like:
       inline bool cpu::add_and_check_carry(unsigned int &a,const unsigned int b);
       a += b; return if carry occurred. */

    void addc(unsigned int &c,const unsigned int d) {
        if (cpu::add_and_check_carry(c,d)) /* becomes ADD EAX,EBX, JNC skip1, XOR EAX,EAX, NOT EAX, [skip1 label] */
            c = ~0u;
    }

    Optimization: If the return value is ignored, the compiler never emits "JNC" nor any code that would run if carry.

If the CPU supports an add with carry, then it should also provide
cpu::add_carry_and_check_carry().

    /* behaves like:
       inline bool cpu::add_carry_and_check_carry(unsigned int &a,const unsigned int b,const bool carry);
       a += b+carry; return if carry occurred */

    void addcc(unsigned int &c,const unsigned int d) {
        /* Becomes:

           ADD EAX,EBX
           ADC EAX,EBX
           JNC skip1
           XOR EAX,EAX
           NOT EAX
    skip1:

           Compiler optimization, if the return value is stored to a variable,
           especially const, and then immediately used in the next, never modified,
           never referenced again, the compiler can just combine them together as
           show in the x86 ASM above. */
        const bool cr = cpu::add_and_check_carry(c,d);
        if (cpu::add_carry_and_check_carry(c,d,cr))
            c = ~0u;
    }

Name spacing is supported using the C++ style :: syntax. To allow multiple
headers to get along where they might conflict. name spacing is recommended.

The compiler itself will provide for compile-time code the compiler namespace including the
include() function.

Compile time functions must be defined using the "compiletime" attribute. Compile-time code
allows if() statements that act upon compile-time variables and macros as a substitute for
the C preprocessor macro system. Compile-time code has the power to conditionally define
functions, variables, and conditionally include headers and modules. Compile-time code must
not use any values or call any functions that cannot be run or evaluated at compile time
including runtime values such as loading address, system state, or runtime functions like malloc
or printf.

Code at the global level (outside of a function block) is implicitly
compile-time. If statements that use ifdef() to detect macros is evaluated at
compile time and can be used to omit code from the compiled binary.

compiletime is not the same as C11 constexpr where code intended to run on the target is being
evaluated at compile time.

built-in compile time functions include:

compiler::error(...)
compiler::warning(...)
compiler::include(...)
compiler::undef(...)
compiler::ifdef(...)
compiler::defval(...)
compiler::define(...)
compiler::exists(...)    To test if a function or variable exists
compiler::barrier()
typeof(...)
sizeof(...)
alignof(...) or _Alignof(...)

As a substitute for the C macro system, compile time code may conditionally
define functions and variables and conditionally include other headers. Macro
names are strings and can therefore contain characters not normally allowed in
an identifier, and there is a type associated with it. Macros can hold
integer, float, string, or compiler::none. none is distinct from nullptr_t
in case of targets where a null pointer is NOT zero however unlikely that is.

using namespace compiler;

include("stdint.h");

if (ifdef("WIN32")) {
	include("windows.h");
	define("WINVER") = 3;
	define("PLATFORM") = "WINDOWS";
	typedef uint16_t textchar_t;
}
else {
	define("PLATFORM") = "LINUX";
	define("UTF-8"); /* default define value is 1 */
	typedef uint8_t textchar_t;
