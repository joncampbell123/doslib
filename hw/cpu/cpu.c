 * Compiles for intended target environments:
 *   - MS-DOS
 *   - Windows 3.0/3.1/95/98/ME
 *   - Windows NT 3.1/3.51/4.0/2000/XP/Vista/7
 *   - OS/2 16-bit
 *   - OS/2 32-bit
 *
 * A common library to autodetect the CPU at runtime. If the program calling us
 * is interested, we can also provide Pentium CPUID and extended CPUID information.
 * Also includes code to autodetect at runtime 1) if SSE is present and 2) if SSE
 * is enabled by the OS and 3) if we can enable SSE. */

 *        We still do the tests so the Windows API cannot deceive us, but we still need GetWinFlags
 *        to tell between 8086 real mode + virtual8086 mode and protected mode. */

    /* FIXME: Prior to adding this check I had no problem with reading CR4 on later

     *        (pre 1993) version of the 80486 that reading CR4 caused a fault and
     *        crash.
     *

     *        I'm guessing it happened probably at the same time that later 80486
     *        processors gained the CPUID instruction.
     *
     *        But I'm not sure.
     *
     *        Also we can't assume clone 80486's from other companies act the same
     *        way. But if CPUID is around we could report it available if and only
     *        if the vendor string is "GenuineIntel" I suppose.
     *
     *        Until I can pin down when it's legal to do it, we assume CR4 exists
     *        only on Pentium or higher.
     *
     *        Not only is this needed to detect if SSE is enabled, but it is also
     *        needed by the DOSLTP library to detect certain characteristics about
     *        paging.
     *
